# These are the *Hack Steps* and notes I've taken/blatently plagerized from Dafyyd Studdard & Marcus Pinto's incredible `Web Application Hacker's Handbook 2nd Edition`
- figured I would put them into one searchable repo so I could get at them at any time and wouldn't have to lug arround my well worn bigass copy with me everywhere.
- Think of it a a cliffsnotes of sorts.
- Not sure how to cite stuff for GitHub but heres a poor attempt at APA format to avoid any copyright lawsuits lol:
